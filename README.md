## Why I made it

While reading about [affect labeling](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17576282/), I learned how beneficial it can be for people to put their feelings into words. I decided to make a web app to ask users 2 simple questions:
- What are you feeling?
- What are you doing?

This may seem pedantic, but I chose *what* over *how* because *what* cues the user to think nonjudgmentally about their own moods, whereas *how* asks them to assign a value of good-bad to it.

Personally, I've found great benefit from using feels and my users have told me the same. If curious, give it a try!
